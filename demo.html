   <center><h1>ASURAN (The Blood Bath ) - 2019</h1></center> <br>
   
        In the late 1970s Kovilpatti, a man and a boy are trekking across a river, carrying 
        homemade bombs. In another part of the village, a woman, a man and a girl are also 
        hiding from the police. 
        Past: The narrator reveals that the man is Sivasaami and the boy is his son
        Chidambaram. In contrast, the woman, man, and child are Sivasaami's wife,
        Pachaiyamma, her brother Murugesan and daughter Lakshmi. They also had an older son
        called Velmurugan. They are a family of farmers living in Thekkoor (lit. southern
        village). Sivasaami has a close relationship with his older son but is distant, and 
        almost abusive with Chidambaram. Sivasaami's family, along with most residents of 
        Thekkoor, are Dalits. Narasimhan is an upper-caste landlord from Vadakoor (lit. 
        northern village), who needs Sivasaami's 3 acres of land for a factory, which the 
        family is against selling, especially Velmurugan

        Pachaiyamma is attacked by one of Narasimhan's sons, to which Velmurugan retaliates 
        by severely injuring him and his men and gets imprisoned consequently. Sivasaami 
        pleads with Narasimhan to get Velmurugan released, and in reply, Narasimhan asks 
        Sivasaami to prostrate before every male resident of the landlord's village as 
        atonement. When Velmurugan hears of his father's humiliation, he beats Narasimhan 
        with a slipper. In revenge, Narasimhan's henchmen, led by a hunter Kariyan, behead 
        Velmurugan and dump his headless body naked in their field. Pachaiyamma is broken 
        with the inability to even complain because of the missing head as evidence and after 
        a year, Chidambaram is compelled to kill Narasimhan in revenge. Sivasaami sees the 
        killing, cuts the street lights there, and tells the family, where they flee with 
        Chidambaram.

        Present: Kariyan is asked to find the pair, tracks them down, and almost kills 
        Chidambaram. Sivasaami defeats them all but kills none. While the two recover, 
        Sivasaami explains why he spared their lives.

        Past: 20 years before, he was a village-famous moonshine brewer and trusted servant 
        to Viswanathan, a landlord. One day, he convinces his boss to employ Pandiyan, 
        Viswanathan's distant relative, as a clerk. Sivasaami's brother Murugan and Venugopal 
        Seshadri, a Brahmin Communist lawyer, are attempting to regain their community's 
        Panchami land from landlords who had seized it illegally. Sivasaami's elder sister's 
        daughter Mariyamma proposes to Sivasaami, who accepts. The family also accepts. 
        Pandiyan slowly gains Viswanathan's trust and becomes his Mill accountant.

        Meanwhile, Sivasaami slowly falls in love with Mariyamma. When Sivasaami gives her 
        sandals to wear, Pandiyan hits her and forces her to walk through the village with 
        the sandals on her head. Sivasaami retaliates by hitting him with sandals in the 
        middle of the village and ties him up, but is reprimanded by Vishwanathan. Sivasaami 
        quits brewing and joins his brother. One night, before a meeting was conducted by 
        Seshadri and Murugan with the other labourers, news arrives that Seshadri was 
        arrested, and Sivasaami is sent to get the documents authorising the meeting. When 
        Sivasaami returns, Murugan and the others have been killed by Pandiyan and his men, 
        while Sivasaami's family (including Mariyamma), along with many others, are burned 
        alive in their huts.

        Enraged, Sivasami brutally kills Vishwanathan, Pandiyan and their men. Sivasaami 
        leaves his village and months later is found by Murugesan, who taught him farming. 
        He's also introduced to Pachaiyamma, who is not getting marriage proposals. He 
        narrates his story, and Pachaiyamma admires what he did for his family. He surrenders 
        to the court and is given a light sentence. Afterwards, he marries Pachaiyamma.

        Present: Chidambaram is amazed at his father's past and starts to admire him. 
        Sivasaami reconciles with his wife and daughter briefly, and he and his son go to 
        Seshadri for help. Seshadri agrees to help them as long as they turn up to court the 
        next day. The next day, the two get into the court premises but are forced to flee 
        after Narasimhan's men ambush them. Sivasaami reluctantly sells his land to prevent 
        Narasimhan's men from targeting his family. However, Chidambaram is abducted and 
        tortured, in direct violation of the agreement. Sivasaami kills many of the henchmen 
        and all of Narasimhan's family male members, though he and Chidambaram sustain 
        serious injuries.

        Murugesan and their village people arrive armed and defuse the situation. The two 
        villages agreed that the conflict should end and prevent a caste clash. Sivasaami's 
        family has gathered in the court, and he has agreed to go to prison instead of 
        Chidambaram if necessary. He tells his son to study hard and get a powerful 
        bureaucratic job, and that, unlike land and money, the landlords can't seize their 
        education, Sivasaami smiles at his family as he enters the court.
